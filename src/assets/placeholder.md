# Assets Directory

This directory should contain all the images and media files for the website:

## Required Images

### Main Images
- `hero-image.png`: A modern illustration showing people using sign language (for the hero section)
- `about-image.png`: An image showing people communicating with sign language (for the about section)

### Alphabet Images (in the alphabet/ subdirectory)
- `a.png` through `z.png`: Images showing the sign language representation of each letter
  - These should be placed in the `alphabet/` subdirectory
  - Each image should be clear and show the hand position for the letter

### Phrase GIFs
- `hello.gif`: Animated GIF showing how to sign "hello"
- `thank-you.gif`: Animated GIF showing how to sign "thank you"
- `please.gif`: Animated GIF showing how to sign "please"

For actual implementation, you would need to replace these placeholders with real images and GIFs from appropriate sources, ensuring that proper attribution is given to the creators.
